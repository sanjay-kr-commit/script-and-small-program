Don't confuse it with a compiler
it add a small bash script at the start of the compiled class or jar file
so you can avoid adding interpreter name and simply run it as if it was a
binary file
it still requires jvm for running and kotlin or jdk for compiling

it does similar to what #! command does to python or bash
just adding interpreter path/name
